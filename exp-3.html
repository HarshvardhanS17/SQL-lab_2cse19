    <h2 align="center">Retrieval of Data Using Conditional and Pattern Matching Queries</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>AIM</h3>
    <p>
        To retrieve and filter data from the EMPLOYEE table using SQL SELECT statements
        with conditions, pattern matching, sorting, arithmetic expressions and logical operators.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>THEORY</h3>

    <p><b>SELECT Statement:</b><br>
        Used to retrieve records from a database table.</p>

    <p><b>WHERE Clause:</b><br>
        Filters records based on specified conditions.</p>

    <p><b>Logical Operators:</b><br>
        AND – Both conditions must be true<br>
        OR – Either condition must be true
    </p>

    <p><b>LIKE Operator:</b><br>
        'A%' – Starts with A<br>
        '%S' – Ends with S<br>
        'A___N' – Five-letter name starting with A and ending with N
    </p>

    <p><b>ORDER BY:</b><br>
        Used to sort records in ascending or descending order.</p>

    <h3>QUESTIONS AND SQL QUERIES</h3>

    <h4>1. List all employees and jobs in Department 30 in descending order by salary.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT ENAME, JOB
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DEPTNO = 30
ORDER BY SAL DESC;
</pre>

    <h4>2. List job and Department Number of employees whose name are five letters long begin with A and end with N.
    </h4>
    <pre>
SELECT JOB, DEPTNO
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE 'A___N';
</pre>

    <h4>3. Display the names of employees whose name start with alphabet S.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%';
</pre>

    <h4>4. Display the names of employees whose name ends with alphabet S.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE '%S';
</pre>

    <h4>5. Display the names of employees working in department 10 or 20 or 40 or employees working as clerk, salesman
        or analyst.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DEPTNO IN (10,20,40)
OR JOB IN ('CLERK','SALESMAN','ANALYST');
</pre>

    <h4>6. Display employee number and names for employees who earn commission.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL
AND COMM > 0;
</pre>

    <h4>7. Display employee number and total salary for each employee.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT EMPNO,
       SAL + IFNULL(COMM,0) AS TOTAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE;
</pre>

    <h4>8. Display employee number and annual salary for each employee.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT EMPNO,
       SAL * 12 AS ANNUAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE;
</pre>

    <h4>9. Display the names of all employees working as clerks and drawing a salary more than 3000.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE JOB = 'CLERK'
AND SAL > 3000;
</pre>

    <h4>10. Display the names of employees who are working as clerk, salesman or analyst and drawing a salary more than
        3000.</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE JOB IN ('CLERK','SALESMAN','ANALYST')
AND SAL > 3000;
</pre>

    <hr>

    <h3>RESULT</h3>
    <p>
        All required retrieval operations were successfully performed using
        conditional filtering, pattern matching, sorting and arithmetic expressions.
